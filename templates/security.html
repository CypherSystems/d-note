    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Self Destruction</p>
        <p class="desc">Every note submitted to the server will eventually
        be destroyed. All unread notes are destroyed after 30 days. All
        notes that have been viewed are destroyed 3 minutes after viewing.
        When the note is destroyed, it is overwritten with random data.
        This application does not make any assumptions about the underlying
        filesystem. Better safe than sorry, we say.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Single View</p>
        <p class="desc">The note can be viewed only once. If someone
        attempts to view the note after the initial viewing, whether or not
        the note has been destroyed, the client is redirected to a standard
        404 error.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">AES Encrypted</p>
        <p class="desc">Before storing the note on disk, every note is
        compressed with ZLIB, then encrypted with AES in CBC mode.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Private Passwords</p>
        <p class="desc">The application uses a shared password server-side
        that is used for the encryption and decryption of all the notes.
        However, the application supports using custom passwords to encrypt
        and decrypt the note. Even though the private password is not
        stored by default in the application, this does not prevent the
        system administrator from modifying the code to do so. Therefore,
        it is best that you host this application yourself, on your own
        server.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Hashcash Protected</p>
        <p class="desc">To prevent spammers from abusing the service, note
        submission is protected by the client solving a proof-of-work
        puzzle by minting a valid <a
        herf="http://hashcash.org">Hashcash</a> token. As such, JavaScript
        is required to post a note. Hashcash tokens are stored on the
        server to prevent double-spending of the same token. Unfortunately,
        minting Hashcash tokens does not work well with mobile
        browsers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p class="title">Anonymous Fingerprints</p>
        <p class="desc">Part of Hashcash tokens is the ability to create a
        uniquely identifiable resource string. Typically, this is an email
        address. However, with this application, your browser fingerprint
        is used as the resource string. The browser fingerprint is a 32-bit
        MurmurHash number. By itself, it cannot identify who it belongs to.
        The system administrator could tie that fingerprint to an IP
        address and user agent string by looking in his web server
        logs.</p>
