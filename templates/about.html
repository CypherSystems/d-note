    <h2>Free and Open Source Software</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/atoponce/d-note">d-note</a> is a Free and
    Open Source Python web application written in Flask. It is licensed under
    the GPLv3, and is available for you to host on your own server.</p>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>It is a platform for sending secure messages that self-destruct
    immediately after being read. Unread messages are automatically deleted
    after 30 days. As such, this application is suitable for sending private
    information such as PINs, usernames, passwords, and other sensitive
    information over insecure channels.</p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All notes are encrypted on the server, and decrypted when the recipient
    views the note. The note can only be viewed once, and the note is securely
    destroyed on the server by overwriting the note with random data before
    deletion. Private passwords can be used to encrypt the note, instead of
    using the default server password. Private passwords are never stored on
    disk. In addition to private passwords, duress keys can be generated which
    will immediately destroy the note without decrypting it, in case you are
    being forced to provide the private password that decrypts the note.</p>
