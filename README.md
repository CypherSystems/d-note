d-note
======

d-note is a self destructing notes web application that you can run on your own
server. A message is created using the web form, and when submitted, a link is
returned that you then send to the recipient. When the recipient opens the
link, the message is displayed and immediately destroyed on the server. Thus,
the link can never be used again for displaying the same note.

See [the installation instructions](/INSTALL.md) on how to install this on your
server.
