d-note
======

Introduction
------------

d-note is a self destructing notes application you can run on your own web
server. I got the idea from a number of websites doing pretty much the same
thing:

* https://oneshar.es/
* https://privnote.com/
* https://quickforget.com/
* https://onetimesecret.com/
* https://burnnote.com/

And many more. Unfortunately, none of the above sites seem to be interested
in benefiting the community as a whole by providing their source code, even
though there seems to be a demand for it. Further, by using a third party
service, you have no guarantee that they are not sharing your data with the
NSA. By running your own server, you know who has your data and who doesn't.

The name of the project is inspired by the "H-Bomb", or hydrogen bomb. I
wanted a clever name for self destructing notes that was not in use, and
something that had a familiar ring to it. "d-note" seemed to fit for
"destructive note", and as already mentioned, inspired by the hydrogen
bomb.

URL Generation
--------------

URLs for self destructing notes should not be predictable in any manner.
Thus, a 22-character base64-encoded string is generated for each
submission. This will give us enough random URLs to avoid a collision with
1 in 2^128. The code should be self-documenting, however, this might
explain things a bit more clearly.

Each URI is built using a random string of data from the Python Crypto library,
built from a 128-bit, or 16-byte number. The URL is then base64 encoded, with
URL-safe characters.

We then encode the string using `base64.urlsafe_b64encode(u.bytes)[:22]`
from the base64 module. This gives us 22 characters for our URL. The valid
characters for our URLs are thus:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUPVXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstupvxyz0123456789-_

So, a valid URL for your self destructing notes could be:

    https://example.com/cWQI4m3fRcW8zM_Mdeg3uQ

There are some notes to consider with this URL scheme:

Its format is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXO, where 'O' is either AgQw.

Regardless, the server would need to be processing 1 billion URLs every
second for 1,000 years before we reached the probability of 1/2 for
generating a duplicate URL.

d-note does not keep track of which URLs have been generated. Thus, it is
possible, although highly improbable, that the same URL could be generated
for two different form submissions. Of course, the application will check
against any valid notes that have not yet self destructed, but will not
check for ones that have.

Thus, it is possible that a URL that has already self destructed could be
regenerated at a different time, which has not self destructed. If the
first URL is publicly accessible, that means that the second URL could be
opened by the wrong recipient accidentally. As such, these URLs should be
kept as private as possible to prevent this from happening.

Hashcash
--------

The point of a Hashcash implementation is to prevent form spam. I'm not
sure what the benefit of spammers would be to use self-destructing notes,
but nonetheless, I'm not really interested in entertaining it.
Implementaning Hashcash as a proof-of-work system is simple enough to
deter most spammers. The breakdown is as follows:

* Server gets client IP address.
* Server generates nonce.
* IP address and nonce become the resource string.
* The resource string is embedded invisibly into the form.
* Client then mints a Hashcash token based on the resource string found.
* The client submits the form with the minted token.
* Server verifies if the token is valid.
    * If valid, the form submits.
    * If not valid, the user is notified submission failed.

A resource string with IP address "65.100.223.163", and nonce "VILymxxv"
generated by the server could look like this:

    65100223163VILymxxv

A minted Hashcash token generated by the client would then need to look
something like this:

    1:20:120715:65100223163vilymxxv::lVb6gfTxYb1Ir5SW:COBt

This is valid, because the SHA1 hash of the above token is:

    00000bed07757ed13f1f2cebc67b616c75812b41

which starts with 20-bits of leading zeros. The work is forced on the
client, which inserts the token into the form. Even on modern hardware,
this should be a strenuous task on the client CPU, and could take up to a
second or two to create a valid token string. However, the server can
verify the token quickly (in nanoseconds).

The minting of the token should be done in the background while the user is
typing the note in the form. Thus, when the submit button is pressed, no
additional waiting is needed.
